# Playbook to change number of workers for nova, neutron, cinder and keystone services
#
# Change Workers Example:
# ansible-playbook -i hosts browbeat/adjustment-workers.yml -e "workers=12"
#
# Change Workers Example and change Keystone Threads (If deployed in httpd)
# ansible-playbook -i hosts browbeat/adjustment-workers.yml -e "service=keystone workers=12 threads=1"
#
# Change Workers and Keystone Deployment Example:
# ansible-playbook -i hosts browbeat/adjustment-workers.yml -e "service=keystone workers=12 keystone_deployment=httpd"
